## Overview

This portfolio website is a personal project created by Tawana Msebele as part of an assignment for the Software Development Scholarship with Powerlearn Project. The site showcases my skills, projects, and background as a 37-year-old software developer with a passion for technology and innovation. It serves as a professional representation of my journey in software development, highlighting my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, IT support, generative AI, and cloud computing.

The site features a modern design with a dark slate gray gradient background, a CSS-generated code snippet overlay, and custom icons for section headings. It includes sections for an introduction, skills, projects, a functional contact form, and contact information, with a unique header and a modernized footer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a clean layout on various screen sizes.
- **Custom Background**: A dark slate gray gradient with a CSS-generated code snippet overlay, reflecting my software development focus.
- **Unique Header**: Left-aligned header with a vertical accent line for a modern, asymmetrical look.
- **Modern Footer**: Gradient background with contact details and placeholder social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn).
- **Section Icons**: Unicode icons for "About Me," "Skills," and "Projects" headings to enhance visual appeal.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays three projects with placeholder images, reflecting my work in software development, cloud computing, and IT support.
- **Functional Contact Form**: A form allowing users to input their name, cell number, email, and a message, integrated with Formspree for submission and JavaScript for validation and feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the site.
